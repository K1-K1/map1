map1.eu
===========

The aim of Map1.eu is to provide an all-purpose map of the whole Europe in a quality close to the printed map's standard. The effort is to realize the potential of openstreetmap data and create larger scale maps suitable for hiking, biking, skiing or geocaching and smaller scale maps applicable as a road atlas. The bold ambition is to create such a map that could be more than an adequate alternative to the standard openstreetmap style.
